## Harvard Forest: fluxbot project 2023
# Repository for fluxbot data collected in fall 2023 at Harvard Forest and associated datasets (LGR, auto-chambers, etc.)

This repository contains the following datasets:
- Harvard Forest fluxbot array, fall 2023 (16 total fluxbots deployed from late September 2023 to early November 2023)
- LGR (sensor testing in the growth chamber, PTFE moisture testing)
- auto-chamber array (existing autochamber setup in healthy, unhealthy hemlock forest at Harvard Forest, long-term installation)
- Harvard Forest weather data (meta-data with which to interpret flux estimates)

The aim of this repository is to contain the data and code associated with a manuscript written by Forbes, Gewirtzman, Kaiser, Palmer et al. and which will demonstrate the utility of a low-cost DIY fluxbot array in detecting small-scale variability in soil carbon fluxes across heterogeneous forest contexts.
